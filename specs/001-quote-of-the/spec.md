## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user seeking daily motivation, I want to access inspirational quotes on demand so that I can find encouragement and share meaningful content with others.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application loads, **When** I click "Get Daily Quote", **Then** I see an inspirational quote with author attribution displayed clearly
2. **Given** a quote is displayed, **When** I click the copy button, **Then** the quote text is copied to my clipboard and I receive confirmation feedback
3. **Given** a quote is displayed, **When** I click a social share button, **Then** a sharing interface opens with the quote pre-populated
4. **Given** I'm using keyboard navigation, **When** I tab through the interface, **Then** all interactive elements receive proper focus indication
5. **Given** the API is unavailable, **When** I request a quote, **Then** I receive a fallback quote from cached content

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the quote API is completely unavailable for extended periods?
- How does the system handle network timeouts during quote fetching?
- What occurs when a user rapidly clicks the quote generation button multiple times?
- How does the application behave on extremely small screen sizes (below 320px)?
- What happens when localStorage is disabled or full?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display inspirational quotes between 10-150 characters in length
- **FR-002**: System MUST attribute each quote to its original author
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a button to generate new quotes on demand
- **FR-004**: System MUST show visual feedback during quote loading (spinner or similar indicator)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display user-friendly error messages when quote fetching fails
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to copy quotes to their device clipboard
- **FR-007**: Users MUST receive confirmation feedback when copying quotes
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide social sharing options for Twitter and LinkedIn
- **FR-009**: System MUST support full keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- **FR-010**: System MUST announce new quotes to screen readers
- **FR-011**: System MUST cache quotes locally for offline access
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent excessive API calls through request debouncing (750ms minimum)
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide fallback quotes when external APIs are unavailable
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for all text
- **FR-016**: System MUST be responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **FR-017**: System MUST retry failed API requests up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **FR-018**: System MUST limit API usage to maximum 100 calls per hour
- **FR-019**: System MUST preload the next quote after displaying current quote for improved performance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Quote**: Represents an inspirational message containing quote text (10-150 characters), author name, unique identifier, and optional category/tags
- **Cache Entry**: Represents locally stored quotes with timestamp, access count, and expiration data for offline functionality

## Tech Stack Summary (Reference from tasks.prompts.md)

### Proposed Tech Stack Summary
- **Frontend Framework**: Angular 20+ with standalone components and signals
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4+ with JIT compilation and responsive utilities
- **State Management**: Angular Signals with computed properties for reactive state
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E, axe-core for accessibility
- **Build Tools**: Angular CLI with ESBuild for optimized performance

### Main Technology Choices Rationale
- **Angular 20+**: Modern framework with excellent TypeScript support, built-in accessibility features, and mature ecosystem
- **Standalone Components**: Simplified architecture without NgModules, better tree-shaking, improved performance
- **Signals**: Native reactive primitives for efficient change detection and state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach for rapid responsive design and consistent styling
- **Jest**: Faster test execution and better developer experience compared to traditional Karma/Jasmine

### Potential Challenges and Risks
- **Angular 20+ Adoption**: Being on the cutting edge may introduce stability risks and limited community resources
- **API Dependency**: External quote APIs may have rate limits, downtime, or pricing changes
- **Performance on Low-end Devices**: Rich animations and transitions may impact performance on older mobile devices
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Achieving WCAG 2.1 Level AA requires thorough testing and ongoing maintenance
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern Angular features may not support older browsers

### Alternative Considerations
- **Framework Alternatives**: React with TypeScript, Vue 3 with Composition API, or vanilla TypeScript
- **Styling Alternatives**: CSS Modules, Styled Components, or traditional SCSS with design system
- **State Management**: NgRx for complex state requirements, or simple RxJS observables
- **Testing Alternatives**: Cypress for E2E testing, Vitest as Jest alternative

### Recommended Next Steps
- **Phase 1**: Set up project structure with Angular CLI and configure Tailwind CSS
- **Phase 2**: Implement core quote display component with basic functionality
- **Phase 3**: Add API integration with error handling and caching
- **Phase 4**: Implement accessibility features and social sharing
- **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and comprehensive testing
- **Phase 6**: Production deployment and monitoring setup
