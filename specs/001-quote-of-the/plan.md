# Implementation Plan: Quote of the Day Web Application

**Branch**: `001-quote-of-the` | **Date**: September 10, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/vijay.subbiah/AI/day-8/daily-quote/specs/001-quote-of-the/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   ✓ Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   ✓ Project Type: web (frontend only - Angular SPA)
   ✓ Structure Decision: Option 1 (Single project) with frontend focus
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   ✓ No constitutional violations identified
   ✓ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check PASS
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   ✓ Research completed - no NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Post-Design Constitution Check pending
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Responsive "Quote of the Day" web component with accessibility compliance, social sharing, and offline functionality. Technical approach: Angular 20+ standalone component with Tailwind CSS, signals-based state management, external API integration with local fallback, and comprehensive accessibility features.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.5+ with Angular 20+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Angular CLI, Tailwind CSS 3.4+, Angular Material 18+, Angular CDK, RxJS 7+  
**Storage**: localStorage for quote caching (50 quotes max), Service Workers for offline access  
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Angular Testing Library, Playwright for E2E, axe-core for accessibility  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+), responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
**Project Type**: web (frontend SPA)  
**Performance Goals**: <1.5s First Contentful Paint, <2.5s Largest Contentful Paint, <100KB initial bundle  
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, 4.5:1 contrast ratio, 750ms API debouncing, 100 API calls/hour limit  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page application, 4 main components, 5 services, ~20 functional requirements

## Constitution Check

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (test MUST fail first)

- Real dependencies used? (actual DBs, not mocks)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas?
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included?
- Frontend logs → backend? (unified stream)
- Error context sufficient?

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change?
- Breaking changes handled? (parallel tests, migration plan)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Frontend SPA with component-based architecture

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   ✓ All technical decisions resolved from tech-stack-plan.md
   ✓ No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remaining

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ✓ Angular 20+ best practices researched
   ✓ Tailwind CSS integration patterns researched  
   ✓ Accessibility implementation strategies researched
   ✓ Quote API integration patterns researched

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   ✓ Complete - all decisions documented with rationale

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   ✓ Quote entity with fields, validation rules, and state transitions
   ✓ CacheEntry entity for localStorage management
   ✓ ApiResponse entity for standardized API responses
   ✓ AppState entity for reactive application state

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   ✓ Component contracts for all 4 main components
   ✓ Service contracts for QuoteService, CacheService, ErrorHandler
   ✓ API contracts for external quote services and fallback
   ✓ HTTP interceptor contracts for retry and rate limiting

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   ✓ Component testing requirements defined
   ✓ Service testing requirements defined
   ✓ Accessibility testing contracts specified
   ✓ Performance testing contracts established

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   ✓ Primary user story validation steps
   ✓ Copy quote scenario with verification
   ✓ Social share scenario with platform integration
   ✓ Accessibility scenario with screen reader testing
   ✓ Offline scenario with cache validation

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   ✓ GitHub Copilot instructions created with Angular 20+ patterns
   ✓ Modern Angular best practices documented
   ✓ Accessibility requirements specified
   ✓ Testing patterns and code quality standards defined

**Output**: ✓ data-model.md, ✓ contracts/, ✓ quickstart.md, ✓ .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base structure
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design documents (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each component contract → component creation task [P]
- Each service contract → service implementation task [P]
- Each API contract → integration task
- Each user story → end-to-end test task
- Implementation tasks ordered to make contract tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **TDD order**: Contract tests before implementation
- **Dependency order**: Models → Services → Components → Integration
- **Parallel execution**: Mark [P] for independent file creation
- **Accessibility first**: A11y tests integrated with component tests

**Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks** (1-5): Project configuration and tooling
2. **Model Tasks** (6-10): Data interfaces and validation [P]
3. **Service Tasks** (11-20): Core business logic and API integration [P]
4. **Component Tasks** (21-30): UI components with accessibility [P]
5. **Integration Tasks** (31-35): End-to-end functionality
6. **Testing Tasks** (36-40): Comprehensive test coverage
7. **Performance Tasks** (41-45): Optimization and deployment

**Estimated Output**: 45 numbered, prioritized tasks in tasks.md with TDD workflow

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - using standard Angular patterns*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | N/A | N/A |
