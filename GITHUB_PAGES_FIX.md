# 🔧 GitHub Pages 404 Issue - SOLUTION STEPS

## ❌ **Issue Identified:**
The GitHub Actions workflow was in the wrong location (`quote-app/.github/`) instead of the repository root (`.github/`).

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Moved GitHub Actions Workflow to Repository Root**
- GitHub Actions only detects workflows in `.github/workflows/` at the repository root
- Moved from `quote-app/.github/workflows/` to `.github/workflows/`

### 2. **Updated Workflow for Subdirectory Structure**
- Added `working-directory: ./quote-app` to all npm commands
- Fixed `cache-dependency-path: 'quote-app/package-lock.json'`
- Updated artifact path to `'./quote-app/dist/quote-app/browser'`

### 3. **Repository Structure Now Correct:**
```
daily-quote/                    # Repository root
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml         # ✅ Correct location
├── quote-app/                 # Angular application
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── dist/
└── other files...
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **Enable GitHub Pages (REQUIRED):**
1. Go to: https://github.com/vijay-subbiah/daily-quote/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **"Save"**

### **Monitor Deployment:**
- Check: https://github.com/vijay-subbiah/daily-quote/actions
- The new workflow should trigger automatically

## 🌐 **Expected Result:**
Once GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" as the source, your app will be available at:
**https://vijay-subbiah.github.io/daily-quote/**

## ⚡ **Status:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow detected and active
- ⏳ Waiting for GitHub Pages to be enabled
- ⏳ New deployment will trigger once Pages is configured

The 404 error should be resolved after enabling GitHub Pages with the correct source setting!
